Embedded Software C++ for Atmega Embedded Microcontroller

Lab 1:
Set-Up Code

Lab 2:
The user can type either a ‘q’ character or a ‘r’ character into the terminal emulator and send it to the
Xplained board. Any other characters will be ignored by the Xplained board. When the Xplained board
receives a ‘q’ character the LED should turn on and the Xplained board should send the message “ON” to
the terminal emulator. When the Xplained board receives a ‘w’ character the LED should turn off and
the Xplained board should send the message “OFF” to the terminal emulator.

Lab 3:
The goal of this lab is to use the LCD display and the UART together so that a user can type
characters on the laptop and they appear on the LCD display.

Lab 4:
The goal of this lab is to make a simple stopwatch using your Xplained board, your LCD display,
and a pushbutton circuit. The stopwatch should have three modes of operation and the stopwatch
should cycle through these three modes, moving from one mode to the next mode each time an
external pushbutton is pressed.

Lab 5-1:
Build a system to adjust the brightness of an LED according to the brightness in the room. The brightness
of the LED should be proportional to the brightness in the room, so the LED should be bright if the room
is bright, and the LED should be dim if the room is dim. Use a photoresistor to sense the brightness in
the room and adjust the brightness of an LED which is external to the Xplained board. 

Lab 5-2:
Build a system to generate a tone using a piezoelectronic buzzer. Use your potentiometer to control the
frequency of the tone. When the potentiometer is turned to one extreme, the tone should have the
frequency 1046Hz and when the potentiometer is turned to the other extreme the tone should have the
frequency 2093Hz. The frequency should change proportionally with the rotation of the potentiometer.

Lab 6:
For this lab you will make a system to change the brightness of an LED using a potentiometer and a
Digital-to-Analog-Converter (DAC). The brightness of the LED will be controlled by turning the
potentiometer which is connected to your Xplained board.
